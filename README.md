# Taidekaari

A tool for artists to upload their art to a web gallery for the event Taidekaari.

This app was an excuse to try out cool new technologies like Astro and their new DB offering.

What else was used:
- Tailwind
- Cloudflare images
- HTMX. Just out of curiosity. And I did not use it to anything else than the "Delete image" functionality. But definately will try with astro + partials in the future.
