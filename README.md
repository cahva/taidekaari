# Taidekaari

A tool for artists to upload their art to a web gallery for the event Taidekaari.

This app was an excuse to try out cool new technologies like Astro and their new DB offering.

This is the Vercel deployment of the app. I first tried to use Cloudflare pages, but it was very slow at the time. The slowness was probably due to Astro DB being new and not optimized for Cloudflare's edge network (or smth).

What else was used:
- Tailwind
- Cloudflare images
- Qwik
